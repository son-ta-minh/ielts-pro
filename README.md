# IELTS Vocab Pro 🚀

> **The ultimate vocabulary mastery tool for high-band IELTS aspirants.**

**IELTS Vocab Pro** goes beyond simple flashcards. It is a comprehensive learning ecosystem designed to help you curate, master, and actively use high-level vocabulary in Speaking and Writing.

## 🌟 Core Philosophy: Context is King

Don't memorize isolated lists.
1.  **Capture**: Add words you encounter in real life.
2.  **Refine**: AI automatically generates definitions, IPA, collocations, and examples tailored to your native language.
3.  **Contextualize**: Generate essays containing *your* specific words to see them in action.
4.  **Practice**: Use them in Speaking and Writing simulations with instant AI grading.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18+).
*   A **Google Gemini API Key** (Free tier available).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ielts-vocab-pro.git
    cd ielts-vocab-pro
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Setup:**
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root.
    *   Add your API Key:
        ```env
        API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
        ```
    *   **Manual AI Workflow (No API Key Required)**: 
        If you prefer not to use an API key or wish to save quota, you can leave the `.env.local` file with the default placeholder (`API_KEY=PLACEHOLDER`). 
        The app supports a **"Manual Mode"**. In this mode, the app generates the prompt for you to copy. You can run this prompt in any external AI tool (like Google AI Studio or ChatGPT) and paste the JSON response back into the app to populate data manually.

4.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Visit `http://localhost:5173`.
